# 🤟🏾 Inato Test


## Context

You will find further explanation in each repository: `api` and `cli`.

I decided to keep some of the files in this root folder such as yarn or nvm while it has not a big impact on the project itself.
But I would be more than happy to discuss it about yes or not to put them here or not. I haven't followed a strict mono-repo structure as I think it's not the purpose of this test.

The API + test and the CLI are working well.
The cli can be installed as global package that would make it easier to use for a product manager for example. 

The big Title `INATO-CLI` in the cli command is completely useless, but it adds quite a nice touch 😁.


## Wrap up

I have enjoy doing this test and I hope you will enjoy reading it. Would love to have more chat about it. I think File structure is a big topic and I would love to have more feedback about it.
While it is such a small project I haven't follow a real DDD structure even though My endpoint is in folder Trial.
